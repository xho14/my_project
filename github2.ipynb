    "### 1. Initializing a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "In your `git_tutorial` directory, initialize a new Git repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `git init` creates an empty Git repository or re-initializes an existing one. It sets up the necessary files and directories for Git to start tracking changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Checking Repository Status\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `git status` displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.\n",
    "- It shows which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Adding Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file named `hello.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"Hello, Git!\" > hello.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the file to the staging area:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add hello.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The **staging area** is a place where you can group changes before committing them. Think of it as a shopping cart where you add items before checking out.\n",
    "- `git add hello.txt` adds `hello.txt` to the staging area, preparing it to be included in the next commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Committing Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Commit the staged changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"Add hello.txt file\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `git commit` records the changes made to the repository.\n",
    "- The `-m` flag allows you to include a commit message inline. This message should briefly describe the changes you've made.\n",
    "- In this example, the commit message is \"Add hello.txt file\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Viewing Commit History\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `git log` shows the commit history, including commit IDs, author information, dates, and commit messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Pushing Changes to Remote Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "After committing your changes locally, you can push them to a remote repository (like GitHub):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push -u origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `git push` uploads your local commits to the remote repository.\n",
    "- `-u` sets the upstream branch, so future pushes can be done simply with `git push`.\n",
    "- `origin` is the default name for the remote repository.\n",
    "- `main` is the name of the branch you're pushing to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Commit and Then Push?**\n",
    "- **Commit**: Saves your changes to the local repository with a message explaining what was changed.\n",
    "- **Push**: Sends your committed changes to a remote repository, allowing others to access them.\n",
    "- This two-step process ensures you have a complete history of your changes locally before sharing them."
